# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repo will build the Call of Red Mountain apk file, which can then be run on any Android device

The app in fact runs all of the elder scrolls series games, and the fallout series as well. So this repo is call

ESE (for elder Scrolls Explorer)
Android (for the code line which is compatible with Android i.e. no awt code)
-apk for the portion of code that puts together an Android Activity

Hence ESEAndroid-apk

By comparision the project ESEAndroid (https://bitbucket.org/philjord/eseandroid) is 
ESE (for elder Scrolls Explorer)
Android (for the code line which is compatible with Android i.e. no awt code)

But that runs on the desktop jre not the android RT

ElderScrollsExplorer (https://github.com/philjord/ElderScrollsExplorer)
Is an AWT version of ESEAndroid that's actually built on ESEAndroid but that uses AWT components to show itself and be navigable.


### How do I get set up? ###

To actually improve teh Call of Red Mountain at a game play level you would need to develop the full stack of code. However to get teh apk building and be
able to do Android style changes this project will get you there.
